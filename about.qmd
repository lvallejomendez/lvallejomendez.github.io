After 14 years working in the AEC* industry, I decide to change my career to Data Science.

Currently, I am enrolled in the [Applied Data Science Degree](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/data-science/presentacion) at [UOC University](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/es/index.html), I have a diversity of interests, from Machine Learning, Advanced Analytics, Cloud Computing, and DevOps, to Architecture, Sustainability, Circular Economy, Sports, and Cooking.

*AEC, Architecture, Enginnering and Construction.*
